next:

  vim - check out command-buffer
  vim - guard commands against use before start
  vim - reorganize python imports (need to be available in all ts buffers,
        even if ftplugin has exited early; but doing them in functions is ugly)

misc:

  repeated showErrors(with update) accumulates copies of io.ts errors

tss:

  describe interfaces (like declarationEmitter, but for accumulated interface;
    could be based on what completions does, with different formatting)
  find a way to combine the advantages of update and reload

  generate JSDOC
  rename? buggy in ts...
  search
    - project by regexp
    - project by type
  visualize
    - module dependencies
    - class dependencies
    - callgraph?

vim:

  can we do automatic updates, with background reload?
  helpfile
